        <p class="main-p"> The brand <strong class="lyl-big">Ninoshka</strong> is the brainchild of designer Ninoshka Alvares-Delaney, which focuses on <strong class="lyl-big">sustainable fashion</strong>. All her products are made of <strong class="lyl-big">natural</strong> and <strong class="lyl-big">organic material</strong>. She uses natural dyes such as indigo, pomegranate, marigold, onion peels, coconut etc. which are <strong class="lyl-big">earth</strong> and <strong class="lyl-big">skin friendly</strong>. She works closely with <strong class="lyl-big">handloom</strong> weavers from across India and uses handloom fabrics such as Khadi, Malkha, Ikat and Chanderi among others. She employs dyeing techniques such as tie and dye, bandhani and shibori, and <strong class="lyl-big">printing</strong> methods such as Ajrakh and Kalamkari. Any embroidery done on garments is done by rural <strong class="lyl-big">Indian artisans</strong>. By working with rural artisans, not only does she create <strong class="lyl-big">employment opportunities</strong>, but also makes sure that the artisans she works with receive <strong class="lyl-big">fair wages</strong>. She believes in the <strong class="lyl-big">Reduce-Reuse-Recycle</strong> philosophy. She <strong class="lyl-big">reduce</strong>s <strong class="lyl-big">wastage</strong> and the use of precious resources by creating <strong class="lyl-big">minimalistic</strong> styles and <strong class="lyl-big">up-cycled fashion</strong>. Some of her designs are constructed in a single stitch line, while some others can be <strong class="lyl-big">reuse</strong>d by wearing a garment inside-out or in multiple ways. She <strong class="lyl-big">recycle</strong>s remnant pieces of fabric to create new fabric.</p>
        <p class="main-p">Ninoshkaâ€™s products aim to create <strong class="lyl-big">social improvement</strong> and <strong class="lyl-big">environment awareness.</p>
